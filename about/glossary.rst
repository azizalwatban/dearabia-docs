   API
      Application Programming Interface. The Open Data Cube Application 
      Programming Interface gives programmers full access to the capabilities
      of the Cube, allowing query and advanced data retrieval.

   ARD
      Analysis Ready Data. Data which has been pre-processed and compiled to 
      make it more accessible. This makes it easier for users to perform their 
      own analysis.
      
   ARN
      Amazon Resource Name. The naming method used by Amazon Web Services to
      unambiguously specify resources.

   AWS
      Amazon Web Services. Cloud computing infrastructure provided by Amazon
      (United States).

   COG
      Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF. A data file format optimised for efficient
      workflows on the cloud and remote reading. See https://www.cogeo.org/.

   EO
      Earth Observation. The field of gathering information about Earth using surveying
      techniques such as satellite-based remote sensing, or ground-based data collection.

   ESA
      European Space Agency
   
   GIS
      Geographic Information System

   Jupyter Notebook
      A user-friendly file type that allows code to be run and presented alongside
      explanatory documentation, figures, and scientific notation. Has the file 
      extension .ipynb.

   JupyterLab
      An interactive web-based user interface for editing and running Jupyter Notebooks.
      JupyterLab is used as an analysis environment on the DE Africa Sandbox.

   Landsat
      A joint NASA/USGS program of medium resolution satellites that have been
      collecting publicly available Earth observation data continuously since 1972.

   NASA
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration (United States)

   NDVI
      Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, calculated from visible and near-infrared
      light reflected by vegetation.

   NIR
      Near Infrared, referring to particular bands used to collect Earth observation
      data

   ODC
      Open Data Cube, an international open-source project developing the technology
      that powers Digital Earth Africa. For more information see
      http://opendatacube.org/.
      
   OGC
      Open Geospatial Consortium
      
   OWS
      OGC Web Services. Geospatial services for data access, display and processing.

   Python
      The programming language used to develop the Open Data Cube. It is easy to use
      while still allowing high performance access and processing capabilities.
      See http://www.python.org/ for more information.

   SAR
      Synthetic Aperture Radar

   Sentinel
      A series of satellites from the ESA Copernicus programme. They collect 
      publicly-available Earth observation data. The program includes the Sentinel-2
      multispectral instrument mission, and the Sentinel-1 SAR mission.

   STAC
     The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is a specification that provides a
     common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can
     more easily be indexed and discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file
     that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.
     See https://stacspec.org/.
